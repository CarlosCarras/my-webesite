                  It began with the User Stories. A set of user stories describes the minimum functionallity that a webpage must have from the perspective of an intended
                  user. User Stories act as a high-level overview of the functionallity of the webpage. They follow a straight-forward template:
              </p>
              <p style={{fontFamily: "Indie Flower", textAlign: "center"}}>
                  {"As a < type of user >, I want < some goal > so that < some reason >"}
              </p>
              <p>
