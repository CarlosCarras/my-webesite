certification exam on my laptop. After spending about five minutes attempting to make the Cartesian\n                                    planes visible, SolidWorks crashed on my laptop. I repeated the same process within the next hour, never getting any further than a few\n                                    sketches and a few extrusions. I left the testing hall that day without a certification, but with a determination to build my own computer\n                                    that could carry me through the rest of my undergraduate courseload.\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n                                    I started looking into the hardware by using analytics from independent testers on websites like YouTube and Reddit. To future-proof my system,\n                                    I settled on an i7 8700K as my CPU and a 1080ti as my GPU. I also wanted a very unique look to my build. I was very into small form-factor builds,\n                                    so I selected a Phanteks Shift case. A little bit of research revealed that nobody had attempted to build a hardline liquid cooling system in this\n                                    case. So I decided to build a hardline liquid cooling system in the Phanteks Shift.\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n                                    Because this case was not designed to fit a watercooling loop, building this computer turned out to be rather complicated. Two radiators were\n                                    installed for maximum heat dissipation; these were press-fit into the lower half of the case. A custom mounting bracket had to be designed to\n                                    fit the pump in the case. This bracket was 3D printed out of ABS plastic (this decision had negative consequences - more on this later).\n                                    Furthermore, a reservoir couldn't be mounted onto the case, so an external reservoir was used during the filling process.\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n                                    The 120mm Noctua fan, originally brown in color, was spray painted black to fit the color scheme. The branding on the power supply was also\n                                    covered up using black vinyl for a sleeker appearance. Finally, the cables were managed behind the side panels to minimize clutter.\n                                </p>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div className=\"three-col-format-column\">\n                            <ul class=\"project-timeline\">\n                                <li class=\"project-timeline-event\" data-date=\"October 5, 2017\">\n                                    <h3>The i7 8700K was launched.</h3>\n                                    <p>So I bought one.</p>\n                                </li>\n                                <li class=\"project-timeline-event\" data-date=\"January 6, 2018\">\n                                    <h3>A test bench was assmebled.</h3>\n                                    <p>It was confirmed that the computed booted to BIOS.</p>\n                                </li>\n                                <li class=\"project-timeline-event\" id=\"date\" data-date=\"January 14, 2018\">\n                                    <h3>A mounting bracket for the pump was designed in CAD.</h3>\n                                    <p>The following day, the mounting bracket was 3D printed out of ABS plastic.</p>\n                                </li>\n                                <li class=\"project-timeline-event\" data-date=\"January 16, 2018\">\n                                    <h3>The liquid cooling loop was assembled.</h3>\n                                    <p>PETG tubing was cut to shape and bent to complete the liquid cooling loop.</p>\n                                </li>\n                                <li class=\"project-timeline-event\" data-date=\"January 29, 2018\">\n                                    <h3>The computer was finished.</h3>\n                                    <p>The loop was flushed with distilled water before being filled with the coolant.
