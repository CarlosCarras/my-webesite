                    On October 2, 2017, I took a SolidWorks certification exam on my laptop. After spending about five minutes attempting to make the Cartesian\n                                    planes visible, SolidWorks crashed on my laptop. I repeated the same process within the next hour, never getting any further than a few\n                                    sketches and a few extrusions. I left the testing hall that day without a certification, but with a determination to build my own computer\n                                    that could carry me through the rest of my undergraduate courseload.\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n                                    I started looking into the hardware by using analytics from independent testers on websites like YouTube and Reddit. To future-proof my system,\n                                    I settled on an i7 8700K as my CPU and a 1080ti as my GPU. I also wanted a very unique look to my build. I was very into small form-factor builds,\n                                    so I selected a Phanteks Shift case. A little bit of research revealed that nobody had attempted to build a hardline liquid cooling system in this\n                                    case. So I decided to build a hardline liquid cooling system in the Phanteks Shift.\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n                                    Because this case was not designed to fit a watercooling loop, building this computer turned out to be rather complicated. Two radiators were\n                                    installed for maximum heat dissipation; these were press-fit into the lower half of the case. A custom mounting bracket had to be designed to\n                                    fit the pump in the case. This bracket was 3D printed out of ABS plastic (this decision had negative consequences - more on this later).\n                                    Furthermore, a reservoir couldn't be mounted onto the case, so an external reservoir was used during the filling process.\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n                                    The 120mm Noctua fan, originally brown in color, was spray painted black to fit the color scheme. The branding on the power supply was also\n                                    covered up using black vinyl for a sleeker appearance. Finally, the cables were managed behind the side panels to minimize clutter. The build\n                                    was now finished.\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n                                    Stress testing reveled that the computer remained cool and quiet under intense workloads. To further test the limits of the build, the CPU was\n                                    overclocked to 5GHz, up from the 3.7GHz base boost-clock. In the process, the ABS pump bracket warped. The warping did not result in any leaks,\n                                    so a new mounting bracket was not installed until it was time to perform maintenance on the cooling system two years later. At this time, a\n                                    mounting bracket was manufactured out of AL6061-T6 on a milling machine.
